# Shiloh OS — Master Project Status

Updated: 2026-08-13
Purpose: permanent project-management source of truth across ChatGPT sessions.

## Authority model

Operational truth remains, in order relevant to the work: GitHub `main`, Render production, Shiloh CRM, Google Calendar, and explicit real WhatsApp/human acceptance evidence.

This file is the **project-management ledger**. Specialist handoffs are execution detail beneath this ledger; they never replace or silently close parent work here. Chat history is supporting context, not the master task list.

## Status legend

- ✅ completed and sufficiently production-verified
- 🔵 active workstream / currently being audited
- ⬜ actionable and unfinished
- 🟡 blocked on external or human truth; never infer
- ⏸ intentionally deferred

## Current technical baseline

- GitHub `main` currently includes PR #156 (`Clear stale client booking state on home escape`).
- The dedicated client audit is documented in `docs/HANDOFF-CLIENT-PERSPECTIVE-TESTING-2026-08-13.md`.
- The prior production handoff remains `docs/HANDOFF-NEXT-CHAT-2026-08-12.md` and is retained as historical/supporting detail, not as a competing master checklist.
- Every new session must verify current GitHub `main` and Render before relying on a commit/deploy identifier recorded here.

# Master remaining-work ledger

## A. Attendance, finalization and earnings

### A1. 🟡 Six known Christel/Abigail attendance finalizations

- Abigail: 2 unresolved.
- Christel: 4 unresolved.
- These require genuine practitioner/supervisor Completed / No-show truth.
- Never infer outcomes from elapsed time, Calendar events, or earnings needs.
- Christel may certify Christel + Abigail visits; Abigail may certify Abigail visits; Jean-Pierre has business-wide review visibility but no routine certification authority.

### A2. ⬜ Production acceptance of finalization/earnings UX

- Verify the simplified practitioner `Finalize past visits` queues from real authorized accounts.
- After A1 is resolved, re-run Abigail and Christel `This Month` reports and verify pending/final state from CRM truth.
- Test Marietjie -> Admin -> Reports -> Marietjie earnings -> This Month.
- Inspect any Marietjie pending visits through her own queue; do not assume zero.
- Fix only established defects.

### A3. 🟡 Staff finalization reminder template

- `shiloh_staff_finalization_v1` last known Meta state: PENDING.
- Fail closed until positive APPROVED state is observed.

## B. Admin acceptance and Jean-Pierre role/testing

### B1. ⬜ Remaining Admin route acceptance

- Continue only genuinely unfinished real-WhatsApp role-specific paths for Christel, Abigail, Marietjie and Jean-Pierre.
- Do not redo regression-locked coverage.
- Verify section -> action -> guarded owner -> Back/Menu behavior and role visibility.

### B2. ⬜ Reconcile Jean-Pierre Admin capability and client-test strategy

Prior requirement to preserve:
- Jean-Pierre needs a practical Admin experience comparable to Christel where business authority permits, but authorization must remain role/authority based rather than blindly cloning certification powers.
- Jean-Pierre also needs to be able to test the genuine first-time client journey.

Decision rule:
- Do **not** disable or weaken Jean-Pierre's production Admin identity merely to test client behavior until the identity-routing architecture is audited.
- `Demo Client` is useful for safe/non-mutating Admin-side simulation, but it is **not sufficient by itself** to certify the true external first-time client journey, WhatsApp identity registration, real CRM creation, Calendar booking, webhook/idempotency, and client-facing UX.
- Use dedicated non-admin client test identities (currently `Dummy Test`, plus Chenique/Juvan resettable test identities where appropriate) for true client acceptance unless a separately designed reversible Admin/client mode switch is proven safe and necessary.

## C. Client Perspective Testing

### C1. 🔵 Dedicated end-to-end client audit

Execution checklist: `docs/HANDOFF-CLIENT-PERSPECTIVE-TESTING-2026-08-13.md`.

This workstream is a child of the broader production acceptance work; it does not replace sections A, B, D or E.

Preserved product requirements/decisions:

- New-client registration supports sequential entry and bundled full-name/mobile/DOB input.
- Post-registration booking is service-family first:
  - Beauty & Aesthetics -> Marietjie.
  - Massage -> Christel or Abigail according to actual CRM eligibility.
  - Lymphatic Drainage -> Abigail only.
- Actual treatment names and practitioner eligibility remain CRM-derived/fail-closed rather than a hard-coded catalogue.
- Clients should be able to understand **which practitioner offers which services** before committing to a booking.
- Conversational questions such as `What does each practitioner do?`, `Tell me about Marietjie`, or `Who does massage?` require an authoritative client-facing answer rather than generic AI invention.
- Current intended practitioner positioning to preserve in client UX:
  - Marietjie: Shiloh's Esthetician / Beauty & Aesthetics practitioner.
  - Christel: Shiloh owner and active Massage practitioner.
  - Abigail: Shiloh Massage practitioner and the practitioner for Lymphatic Drainage.
- Booking must not hide practitioner choice behind an optional default where a meaningful client choice exists. For a service with multiple eligible practitioners, offer the eligible choices (and `Any available` where appropriate); where only one practitioner is genuinely eligible, skip an unnecessary choice while clearly communicating who will provide the treatment.

### C2. ⬜ Practitioner-information conversational audit

- Verify the AI/client route can answer practitioner-role/service questions from authoritative CRM/configured business knowledge.
- Verify no invented qualifications, services, ownership claims or eligibility.
- Ensure service-family UI and free-text answers tell the same operational story.
- Add regression coverage and production acceptance where gaps are established.

### C3. ⬜ True first-time booking acceptance

- Complete a controlled real-client registration -> family -> treatment -> practitioner resolution -> date/time -> confirmation journey.
- Verify canonical CRM appointment and Google Calendar event.
- Verify retry/idempotency and supported cancellation/cleanup behavior.
- `Dummy Test` is the preferred dedicated work-time client identity unless authoritative evidence changes this.

## D. Client lifecycle / automation blockers

### D1. 🟡 Birthday automation

- `shiloh_birthday_wish_v2` last known Meta state: PENDING.
- Keep sending disabled until positively APPROVED and copy/current configuration is verified.

## E. P4 payments / Ozow

### E1. 🟡 Ozow activation gate

- Blocked on actual Ozow merchant/account configuration and explicit Shiloh rules for payable amount/deposit/full payment, refunds and Shiloh-issued gift vouchers.
- Payment truth remains separate from booking, attendance, Calendar and loyalty truth.

### E2. ⬜ Safe P4 engineering after higher-priority acceptance is clean

- Continue only provider-independent/sandbox-safe contracts, reconciliation/idempotency, sanitized observability and tests.
- No live payment activation while E1 is unresolved.

# Cross-chat continuity protocol — mandatory

1. Every Shiloh OS chat starts by reading this file first.
2. Verify GitHub `main` and Render production before claiming the current deployed baseline.
3. If the active item links to a specialist handoff, read that handoff second.
4. Never create a new independent master checklist in a specialist handoff.
5. New findings are added to this ledger under the correct parent workstream; they are not allowed to disappear merely because the chat changes.
6. When work is completed, update the relevant status here only after evidence supports completion.
7. When a task is blocked, mark/preserve 🟡 and continue to the highest-priority genuine ⬜ item rather than silently dropping it.
8. Before ending a substantial work session, reconcile this ledger against any specialist handoff changed during that session.
9. Do not mark human truth (attendance, payment, identity, cancellation, etc.) complete by inference.

# Current recommended execution order

1. 🔵 Continue Client Perspective Testing because it is the currently active acceptance workstream; incorporate C2 practitioner-information/service-visibility acceptance rather than losing it.
2. ⬜ In parallel where non-mutating, continue A2/B1 evidence gathering without requiring A1 attendance outcomes.
3. 🟡 Preserve A1, A3, D1 and E1 until their real external/human facts become available.
4. ⬜ Return to safe P4 engineering only after the higher-priority production acceptance work is clean.

# Standard new-chat prompt

**Shiloh OS**

Continue from `docs/SHILOH-OS-MASTER-STATUS.md`. Treat it as the permanent project-management ledger.

Treat GitHub `main`, Render production, Shiloh CRM, Google Calendar and explicit real WhatsApp/human acceptance evidence as operational truth.

Read the master ledger first, then read the specialist handoff linked by the currently active workstream. Do not create a competing checklist or redo completed work. Preserve all 🟡 blockers and continue with the highest-priority genuine ⬜ item. Apply the safe self-test-first engineering rule automatically. Update the master ledger when evidence changes project status.
