# Shiloh Production Maintenance & Rollback Runbook

Current operating rule: normal `npm start` boots the HTTP service and long-running schedulers only. Migrations, repairs, production smoke checks, rollout jobs, Goldie imports and Google Calendar reconciliations are explicit operator actions and must never be coupled to a Render restart/deploy.

## Normal deploy verification

1. Confirm the intended GitHub `main` commit.
2. Wait for GitHub Actions CI to complete successfully.
3. Confirm Render deployed the same commit and reports `live`.
4. Confirm `/health` returns HTTP 200 with database `ok`.
5. Review startup logs. Expected recurring schedulers are Goldie knowledge sync, Google Business Profile sync when configured, appointment lifecycle, and customer care. One-time repair/import/reconciliation jobs must not appear during ordinary startup.

## Running maintenance explicitly

List commands with:

```bash
npm run maintenance -- help
```

Read-only examples:

```bash
npm run maintenance -- chenique-diagnostic
npm run maintenance -- p2-staff-smoke
npm run maintenance -- google-calendar-reconcile-dry-run
npm run maintenance -- goldie-future-import-dry-run
```

Mutating commands require an explicit acknowledgement:

```bash
npm run maintenance -- google-calendar-reconcile-commit --confirm
npm run maintenance -- goldie-future-import-commit --confirm
npm run maintenance -- catalogue-polish --confirm
```

The legacy `startup-test-command` is also treated as a write because it records a run in the database. Its WhatsApp reply is **suppressed by default**. Sending its test reply requires both acknowledgements:

```bash
npm run maintenance -- startup-test-command --confirm --allow-whatsapp
```

Do not use `--allow-whatsapp` during routine verification. Never run a write command merely to test that it works. Prefer a read-only/dry-run command and inspect the result first. Do not use genuine appointments for destructive testing and do not send unnecessary WhatsApp messages to real clients.

## Assistant-operated named maintenance framework

The repository contains an inert contract framework for the separately ratified assistant PostgreSQL maintenance architecture. It is not a production executor.

Current framework files:

- `src/maintenance/operationFramework.js` — validates immutable named-operation contracts.
- `config/maintenance-operation-manifest.js` — versioned registry surface. The live manifest is intentionally empty until a separately reviewed operation is added.
- `tests/maintenance-operation-framework.test.js` — deterministic fail-closed contract tests.

The framework enforces the design boundary for future exact operations:

- operation IDs are named and versioned;
- classification is explicit (`read` or `write`);
- exact Git commit and Control authorization reference are part of the operation contract;
- arbitrary SQL, raw command, shell, secret and connection-string fields are rejected;
- exact confirmation tokens are bound to operation ID/version;
- write contracts require lock, timeout, precondition, expected-state, precommit and independent read-only postcommit verification declarations;
- write contracts require a replay-prevention interface;
- structured result keys that imply identity, credentials or raw payloads are rejected;
- unknown operation names fail closed.

The repository framework deliberately does **not** implement a production replay ledger, database role, credential, network path, job executor, HTTP route, shell, One-Off Job trigger or direct database connection. Those remain separately gated.

A merge/deploy containing this framework must not execute a maintenance operation. Normal `npm start` remains independent from the maintenance-operation registry. CI runs the focused framework tests before the full non-mutating regression suite.

A future live operation must not become executable merely because its definition exists in Git. It still requires the first-party bounded execution capability and a separate exact Control authorization, including review of its commit, immutable operation contract, expected effects, failure/rollback behavior and verification plan.

## Pre-write checklist

Before any mutating maintenance command:

1. Record the current GitHub commit and current live Render deploy ID.
2. Confirm the command's intended scope and environment values.
3. Run the corresponding dry-run/read-only check when one exists.
4. Confirm database backup/PITR availability in Render for database-changing work; if no suitable recovery point is available, do not proceed with a risky bulk mutation.
5. For Calendar work, identify exact affected calendar/event scope and avoid bulk destructive changes to genuine appointments.
6. For Goldie work, retain the source export/checksum outside Git and confirm no client messaging path is invoked.

For any future assistant-operated named maintenance write, also require the separately ratified operation contract: exact authorization, exact commit/checksum, live same-transaction fail-closed preconditions, expected-state assertions, all-or-nothing transactionality, replay protection, sanitized evidence and independent read-only post-state verification.

## Application rollback

If a code deploy regresses production but no maintenance write has been executed:

1. Revert the offending GitHub commit (preferred) or restore the last known-good tree on `main`.
2. Let Render auto-deploy the rollback commit.
3. Verify CI, Render `live`, `/health` 200 and startup logs.
4. Confirm no one-time maintenance command ran during the deploy.

A code rollback does **not** undo database or Calendar mutations already committed by an explicit maintenance command.

## Data/Calendar rollback

For a database-changing maintenance command, use the recorded pre-write recovery point plus the command's audit/output to determine the narrowest safe recovery. Do not blindly restore the whole production database if a scoped corrective transaction is safer.

For Google Calendar, prefer an idempotent/tightly scoped corrective reconciliation. Never delete or recreate genuine appointments simply to prove a rollback path.

If a command partially fails, preserve logs/output, stop further writes, verify CRM and Calendar state read-only, then choose the smallest corrective action. Do not rerun a mutating command repeatedly unless its idempotency and current state are understood.

## Goldie cutover protection

Goldie remains connected until the documented exit gate is fully cleared: fresh final export, future-booking delta comparison, delta import/reconciliation, zero unresolved future bookings, and final CRM/Calendar verification. Maintenance cleanup does not alter that gate.

## Safety invariants

- No impersonating Marietjie or Abigail.
- No unnecessary messages to real clients.
- No destructive testing against genuine CRM/Calendar appointments.
- Write maintenance commands require `--confirm`.
- WhatsApp-capable maintenance commands suppress messaging unless `--allow-whatsapp` is explicitly supplied.
- Assistant-operated named maintenance remains non-executable until separately authorized and supported by a bounded first-party execution mechanism.
- Prefer dry-run/read-only verification first.
- Do not disconnect Goldie until the exit gate is fully verified.
