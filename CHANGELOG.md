# Changelog

All notable changes to Shiloh are documented in this file.

This project follows Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-11

### Production CRM & Customer Experience

#### Added
- CRM-backed booking and customer lifecycle with Shiloh replacing Goldie as the active booking system of record.
- Staff-scoped WhatsApp administration with owner/business-admin and practitioner-specific permissions.
- Dedicated Google Calendars for Marietjie and Abigail with practitioner-scoped appointment visibility.
- Public Shiloh booking landing page with direct WhatsApp AI booking intent.
- Public CRM-backed service catalogue with professional descriptions, service imagery and WhatsApp deep links.
- Versioned Booking Policy with explicit WhatsApp consent gate and safe synthetic production verification.
- Staff-scoped operational `Today` reporting with business-wide owner/admin summaries and practitioner-self summaries.
- Birthday customer-care foundations, opt-in/out controls, once-per-year delivery protection and Meta template provisioning workflow.
- Loyalty visit and reward foundations based on completed appointments.
- Walk-in QR registration and premium customer greeting flows.
- Client cancellation/rescheduling, booking confirmation, calendar-add and customer-care scheduling infrastructure.

#### Changed
- Retired Goldie from active production booking; historical Goldie data remains archival only.
- Established Shiloh CRM and Google Calendar as authoritative operational sources alongside GitHub `main` and Render production.
- Updated public booking branding to `Shiloh Massage Therapy and Aesthetic Clinic` and identified Shiloh as the AI assistant.
- Added the Shiloh booking URL as the preferred Google Business Profile booking link while Goldie provider-link removal completes.
- Hardened normal startup so only intended long-running production schedulers run automatically.

#### Production hardening
- Safe self-test-first engineering is now the authoritative change-management rule.
- Regression suite protects staff scope, calendar presentation, booking conflict guards, cancellation synchronization, post-cutover startup and maintenance safety acknowledgements.
- Fixed OpenAI language-guard compatibility by using the provider-supported minimum output-token budget while retaining fail-open WhatsApp availability.
- Removed temporary birthday-template startup inspection hooks after provider-side submission.
- GitHub CI and Render auto-deploy remain the release validation path.

#### Pending P3 work
- WhatsApp birthday template approval/configuration, including resolving the legacy clinic-name wording before enabling outbound birthday delivery.
- Treatment-aware aftercare and rebooking specialization.
- Loyalty redemption automation.
- Reporting expansion: Tomorrow → This Week → Services/Trends → Availability → optional weekly owner summary.
- Optional dedicated reminder-confirmation response state.

#### Next phase
- P4 Ozow/payment/voucher architecture remains unstarted and will begin with discovery/design, payment-ledger truth, webhook idempotency and voucher lifecycle design.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-07

### Maintenance
- Upgraded the official OpenAI JavaScript/TypeScript SDK from the 5.x line to `7.1.0`.
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` and verified a clean `npm ci` install on Node.js 24.14.1.
